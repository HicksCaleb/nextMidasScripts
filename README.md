# nextMidasScripts
These are some scripts to help readout .mid files created at the ACU NEXT lab. 
Just call them with a python interpreter and give them the .mid file you want to convert.
They have a second optional argument for the output file name.
the testRootOutput takes a root file and the channel to plot, then plots that channel's data against the serial number
